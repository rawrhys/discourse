# Test Guide for Fixed Issues

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Credit Count Not Updating on Frontend
**Problem**: Credits weren't updating in real-time after course generation or payment
**Solution**: 
- Added `/api/user/credits` endpoint for real-time credit updates
- Updated frontend to use dedicated credits API
- Added credit updates in course completion events

**Test Steps**:
1. Start the application: `npm run dev`
2. Log in to the dashboard
3. Note your current credit count
4. Generate a course
5. Verify credit count decreases by 1 immediately
6. Complete payment process
7. Verify credit count increases by 10

### 2. Loading Screen Hanging During AI Generation
**Problem**: Loading screen would hang indefinitely during course generation
**Solution**:
- Improved streaming response handling
- Added completion event tracking
- Added fallback completion detection
- Enhanced error handling for stream interruptions

**Test Steps**:
1. Start course generation
2. Watch the progress modal
3. Verify it shows real-time progress updates
4. Verify it completes and redirects to the course
5. Check console for proper completion events

### 3. Course Generation Not Redirecting to Saved Course
**Problem**: After generation, users weren't redirected to their new course
**Solution**:
- Enhanced course completion event with proper course ID
- Improved navigation logic in frontend
- Added fallback to refresh saved courses

**Test Steps**:
1. Generate a new course
2. Wait for completion
3. Verify automatic redirect to `/course/{courseId}`
4. Verify the course is properly saved and accessible
