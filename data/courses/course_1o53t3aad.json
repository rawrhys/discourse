The period began with the assassination of Emperor Alexander Severus in 235 AD, marking the start of a fifty-year span during which more than twenty emperors ruled, often with overlapping claims to the throne. This political instability was exacerbated by external pressures, including invasions by Germanic tribes and the Sassanid Empire, which stretched military resources to their limits.\n\nEconomically, the crisis was marked by hyperinflation, a debased currency, and a decline in trade. The financial strain led to increased taxation and confiscations, further alienating the populace and provincial elites. Socially, the crisis saw widespread unrest, including peasant revolts and the rise of banditry. The plague of Cyprian, which struck in the mid-3rd century, added to the chaos, causing significant population loss and further economic disruption.\n\nOne of the most notable responses to the crisis was the rise of soldier emperors, who often came from the ranks of the military rather than the traditional senatorial class. These emperors, such as Decius and Aurelian, implemented various reforms aimed at stabilizing the empire. However, their efforts were by continued military threats and internal power struggles. The crisis also saw the emergence of the concept of the \"divine right\" of emperors, as rulers sought to legitimize their authority through religious and mystical means.",

Understanding this period is crucial for grasping the transformations that led to the Late Antique world and the eventual division of the Roman Empire. In our next lesson, we will explore the reforms and changes that followed this crisis, shaping the future of the Roman world."
