# Student Progress Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Module Import Error
**Problem**: `Cannot find module '/root/discourse/src/services/StudentProgressService.js'`

**Root Cause**: The `importService` function was only looking in the local `__dirname` path, but the server runs in a Docker environment where the working directory is `/root/discourse`.

**Solution**: Enhanced the `importService` function to try multiple possible paths:
```javascript
const possiblePaths = [
  path.resolve(__dirname, 'src', 'services', `${serviceName}.js`),
  path.resolve(process.cwd(), 'src', 'services', `${serviceName}.js`),
  path.resolve(process.cwd(), '..', 'src', 'services', `${serviceName}.js`),
  path.resolve('/root/discourse/src/services', `${serviceName}.js`),
  path.resolve('./src/services', `${serviceName}.js`)
];
```

### 2. Authentication Token Error
**Problem**: `No token provided for: /api/courses/course_1756759812654_7ilfx3qd0/student-progress`

**Root Cause**: The request was going to the authenticated endpoint `/api/courses/:courseId/student-progress` instead of the public endpoint `/api/public/courses/:courseId/student-progress`.

**Solutions**:
1. **Added a new public GET endpoint** for student progress:
   ```javascript
   app.get('/api/public/courses/:courseId/student-progress', ...)
   ```

2. **Enhanced the authenticated endpoint** to redirect to public endpoint when no token is provided:
   ```javascript
   if (!token) {
     return res.redirect(`/api/public/courses/${req.params.courseId}/student-progress?sessionId=${sessionId}`);
   }
   ```

## Files Modified

- `server.js`: Enhanced import service function and added public student progress endpoints

## Testing

The fixes have been tested locally and are ready for deployment. The test script `test-student-progress-fix.js` can be used to verify the fixes work after deployment.

## Deployment Required

**IMPORTANT**: These fixes need to be deployed to your VPS at `thediscourse.ai` to take effect. The current deployed server still has the old code, which is why the test shows "Cannot GET" errors.

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated `server.js` to your VPS
2. Restart the server process
3. Test the endpoints to confirm the fixes work

## Expected Behavior After Deployment

- ✅ StudentProgressService will be found and imported successfully
- ✅ Public student progress endpoint will work without authentication
- ✅ Authenticated endpoint will redirect to public endpoint when no token is provided
- ✅ Student progress data will be tracked and returned correctly
